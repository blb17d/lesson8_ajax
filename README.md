### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this project we used Json which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is used for storing and exchanging data and is a part of JavaScript. The benefit is that it is simple and easy to understand. It is also similar to most programing languages. 
2. Ajax is another topic covered which allows web pages to be more efficient by retrieving information without having to completely reload the web page. It relies on retrieving information from JavaScript.  Google search is one the first real applications of Ajax. 
3. However, Ajax has some limiations. Not every web server and browser can support this method. Sometimes the data has to be retrieved from a seperate web service. A web service is a source for data that is then made avaiable on one domain for simple use on domains across the web.
